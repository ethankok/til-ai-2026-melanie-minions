# NLP — notes & history

Last updated: 14 May 2026 13:35 SGT

Per-task working log for NLP (RAG question-answering). For the authoritative input/output/scoring spec see
[README.md](README.md) and the official [Challenge specifications](https://github.com/til-ai/til-26/wiki/Challenge-specifications#nlp).
For submission history across all tasks see [../RESULTS.md](../RESULTS.md).

## Current shipped tag

**`v4-dict-id` — official 0.483 / 0.888 (14 May 13:29 SGT, 0 of 700 errors).** NEW HIGH on the post-wipe leaderboard. Same image bits as `v3-id-parse`; the 0.000 → 0.483 jump came entirely from Ryan fixing his eval-server bug (it had been sending plain strings instead of `{"id":"DOC-XXXX","document":"..."}` dicts). Our defensive parser caught the dict shape on first try once the real format started flowing.

## New eval (FINAL — pinned 14 May)

Per organisers, the NLP evaluator is now frozen in this state:

- Submit top-3 document IDs in `documents`. If any of the first 3 matches the target, retrieval succeeds. >3 → only first 3 considered; <3 → only those.
- Answer cleaned of non-printable chars and truncated to 64 tokens server-side.
- Answer-equivalence threshold raised from 0.5 to **0.9** (same ModernBERT weights).
- Retrieval ✗ → 0.0 outright. Retrieval ✓ + answer ✗ → 0.4. Retrieval ✓ + answer ✓ → 1.0.

Old NLP leaderboard was wiped on rollout.

Response shape (per-question):
```json
{"documents": ["DOC-0001"], "answer": "This is my answer."}
```
Corpus-load response: `{"predictions": [{"status": "loaded"}]}`.

## Doc-ID format (resolved 14 May 09:33 SGT)

Initially the blank `nlp_manager.py` template typed `load_corpus(documents: list[str])` and the wiki showed plain strings, which led `v2-hybrid-rag` and `v3-id-parse` to both score 0.000 on the cloud (`0 / 700` errors but every retrieval missed). Investigation showed:

- `/home/jupyter/novice/nlp/documents/` has **296 files spanning DOC-0001..DOC-0340 with 44 gaps** in the ID range.
- `nlp.jsonl` `source_docs` uses real filename IDs.
- Document content has no DOC-XXXX prefix.

Ryan then confirmed on hackoverflow that his eval server had a bug: it was supposed to send dicts, not plain strings. After his fix, the real format is:

```json
{
  "instances": [{
    "documents": [
      {"id": "DOC-0001", "document": "Text of document one."},
      {"id": "DOC-0002", "document": "Text of document two."}
    ]
  }]
}
```

The template signature was also updated to `load_corpus(documents: list[dict[str, str]])`. Our `_parse_doc_payload` was already defensive across three encodings, including the dict shape with `id`+`document` keys — so `v4-dict-id` (same image as `v3-id-parse`, re-tagged) caught the new format immediately and scored `0.483 / 0.888` on the next submission.

## Implementation (`v4-dict-id`, same image as `v3-id-parse`)

End-to-end overhaul in [src/nlp_manager.py](src/nlp_manager.py) and [src/nlp_server.py](src/nlp_server.py):

1. **Server.** Matches Ryan's pre-written async + poll pattern verbatim — `{"status":"loading"}` then `{"status":"loaded"}` on the poll endpoint; per-question response is `{"documents":[...], "answer":"..."}`.
2. **Doc-ID parser.** `_parse_doc_payload` handles three encodings: dict shape with `id` key, first-line `DOC-XXXX` (stripped from body), `DOC-XXXX` within the first 80 chars, and positional fallback `DOC-{i+1:04d}`. Cloud uses the dict shape; our parser caught it on first try.
3. **Chunking.** 3-sentence sliding window with 1-sentence overlap; each chunk carries its parent doc index.
4. **Hybrid retrieval.** BM25Okapi over tokenized chunks ⊕ dense cosine over `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` embeddings (CLS-pooled, L2-normalized; query gets BGE's English search prefix). Per-query z-score normalise then sum. Top-30 chunks → reranker.
5. **Cross-encoder rerank.** `BAAI/bge-reranker-base` scores `(question, chunk)` pairs. Top-10 → QA. Top-3 unique parent docs become the response `documents`.
6. **Extractive QA.** `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` over each of the top reranked chunks; pick the highest-scoring span ≤64 tokens. Extractive (vs generative) is the right play because (a) Clairos has fictional proper nouns pretrained LMs don't know, and (b) the 0.9 ModernBERT threshold rewards near-verbatim spans from the source.
7. **Speed.** GPU half-precision on all three models. Cloud speed `0.888` confirms the inference budget is fine.

Weights baked into the image via [download_models.py](download_models.py). Container runs offline (`TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1`). `NLP_MODEL_DIR=/workspace/models`.

Track: **Novice** — no L4/L5 handling code.

## Local performance

With the upstream `test_nlp.py` (which now sends `{"id": doc_file.stem, "document": content}` per doc):

```text
Answer Equivalence Evaluation Summary:
  n=883, equiv_rate=0.678, mean_prob=0.521,
  equivalent_count=598.8, not_equivalent_count=284.2
NLP RAG QA Accuracy: 0.678
```

`equivalent_count` is fractional because retrieval-only successes earn `RETRIEVAL_ONLY_SCORE=0.4` partial credit. The 0.678 is a blend of full credit (1.0), retrieval-only (0.4), and zero. Net: pipeline correctly retrieves + extracts most of the time.

Local 0.678 → cloud 0.483 is a `~0.20` gap, consistent with AE/CV local→official gaps on this competition. Held-out corpus is likely distribution-shifted (different topic mix or document length) but otherwise the pipeline transfers cleanly.

## Submission history

```

## What needs doing

1. **Batch SQuAD2 forward pass.** `QA_BATCH=16` is defined but unused — `_extract_answer` processes one context at a time. Batching the forward pass over top-10 reranked chunks should free 50–80% of QA latency budget. Highest-impact, lowest-risk next move.
2. **Paragraph-aware chunking.** Currently sentence-windowed. Splitting on `\n\n` first preserves answer spans that cross sentence boundaries; common failure mode in RAG.
3. **Bigger embedder/reranker** (after #1 frees the latency budget). `bge-base-en-v1.5` instead of `bge-small`; `bge-reranker-large` instead of base. Adds ~700 MB to the image.
4. **Bigger QA model.** `deepset/roberta-large-squad2` (~1.4 GB). Worth trying after #1+#2.
5. **Sentence-of-best-chunk fallback** when SQuAD2 confidence is low. Cheap dropin; helps the "right doc, wrong span" failure mode.

Estimated reachable: cloud `0.55–0.65` with #1+#2 alone, more with #3/#4.

## What to edit, what not to

- [src/nlp_manager.py](src/nlp_manager.py) — main logic. All next-priority work lives here.
- [src/nlp_server.py](src/nlp_server.py) — Ryan's pre-written verbatim; don't drift from upstream.
- [Dockerfile](Dockerfile), [requirements.txt](requirements.txt), [download_models.py](download_models.py) — packaging.
- `test/test_nlp.py` is the **updated upstream** (sends dicts with `id` + `document`). No local patch needed any more.
